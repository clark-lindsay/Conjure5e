# Conjure5e

A small library to ease the use of conjuration spells in the 5th edition
of Dungeons and Dragons that summon random, parameterized creatures.

I have used this library to build a web application, which can be found at https://conjure5e.herokuapp.com  
If you are interested in the code for the web application, the repo is https://github.com/clark-lindsay/conjure-web

## Downloading and Installing

`yarn add conjure5e`
OR
`npm install conjure5e`
