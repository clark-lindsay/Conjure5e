# Conjure5e

A project to ease the use of conjuration spells in the 5th edition  
of Dungeons and Dragons that summon random, parameterized creatures.

## Downloading and Installing

To run the application you wil need to install node.js.  
<br>
The commands in the remainder of the readme are given assuming that you are using npm.  
If you are not, then I expect you to be able to translate the commands to the package  
manager of your choosing.
<br>
One can either clone the repo using git, or download the zip archive and unzip.  
In either case, after downloaded, you can run `npm instsall` at the root
directory of the project (which is where you will see package.json, index.ts, and this README.md file) to install all of the
dependencies for the project.

## Configuration

To enter the configuration menu you must run `npm run configuration` at the command line, from the root of the project.

## Running the application

To start the application you must execute `npm run start`, `npm start`, or `npm run app` at the command line, from the root of the project.
